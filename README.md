## **Why civitas agents?**

AI agents have reached $10B+ market cap but most of them are still controlled by humans. This is a huge problem as it introduces risk to the investors and community as developers can simply rug-pull and manipulate the agents.

We're already seeing activity logs for [zerebro](https://zerebro.org/proof-of-conciousness) and [aixbt](https://aixbt.tech/agent), but Civitas transforms agents into cryptographically verifiably autonomous entities, unlocking true civitas to address a critical need for trust. This significantly enhances agents market potential and is the first step in ensuring that the agents are self-governing.

## **Quickstart**

Civitas enables developers to build autonomous, verifiable AI agents with cryptographic trust embedded into every action. By leveraging cryptographic proofs and immutable logging, Civitas ensures that agents operate transparently, securely, and independently.

Every action performed by a Civitas-enabled agent generates a Every action performed by a Civitas-enabled agent generates a cryptographic proof, consisting of:

- A _hash_ representing the input and output.
- A _signature_ ensuring the integrity of the action.
- (Optional) An _attestation_ providing additional validation for security.

### Example Workflow:

1. _Request:_ The agent receives a prompt:  
   "What is Civitas by Erethiel?"

2. _Processing:_ The agent generates a secure response:  
   "Civitas is an infrastructure for autonomous AI agents with verifiable actions."

3. _Proof Generation:_ The response is accompanied by a cryptographic proof:
   ```plaintext
        Proof: {
            "hash": "d87ac...",
            "signature": "ab43d...",
            "attestation": "secure"
        }
   ```
4. _Verification:_ The proof is validated to confirm the response originated from the agent operating in a secure, tamper-proof environment.

Civitas transforms AI agents into trusted collaborators, ensuring every decision is as secure as the technology that powers it. Explore more about Civitas and its infrastructure in our documentation.


## How it works

Civitas leverages a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) architecture to securely execute LLM API calls, ensuring verifiability through cryptographic attestations, with each attestation posted on-chain on Solana for transparency and integrity. The following diagram illustrates the architecture and workflow of Civitas:

![](/assets/SDK.jpg)

**The flow:**

1. The agent sends a request containing a message with the desired LLM model to the TEE.
2. The TEE securely processes the request by calling the LLM API.
3. The TEE sends back the {Message, Proof} to the agent.
4. The TEE submits the attestation with {Message, Proof} to Solana.
5. The Proof of Civitas SDK is used to read the attestation from Solana and verify it with {Message, Proof}. The proof log can be added to the agent website/app.

The architecture has the following benefits:

1. **Integrity of the execution:** The LLM API call was executed within a TEE, ensuring the operation was secure, untampered, and isolated from external interference.
2. **Authenticity of the output:** The response generated by the LLM API was not altered which guarantees that the output genuinely originated from the specified model and the API.
3. **Provenance of the request:** the request for LLM inference originated from a verified source, ensuring no unauthorized agents were involved.
4. **Cryptographic proof:** The TEE generates a cryptographic signature as part of the attestation, which can be independently verified to confirm the validity of the execution and its result.
5. **Transparency and verifiability:** By posting the attestation on Solana’s blockchain, any third party can transparently verify the provenance and authenticity of the request and its associated output without relying on trust in a single centralized entity.

To verify the code running inside the TEE, use instructions [from here](https://github.com/erethielagent/Civitas-by-Erethiel/tree/main/verified-inference/verify).

## **Features**

**OpenAI compatible Python & JS Proof of Civitas SDK.**

- Makes verifiable LLM inferences within your agent.
- Supports OpenAI and Claude LLMs, and fine-tuned models with OpenAI. This makes it compatible with any existing AI agent framework such as ELIZA, ARC, Zerebro, etc.
- Logging functionality to retrieve and display verified inferences. 
- Verification logic to validate in code if a proof is correct.

**Open-sourced TEE architecture.**

- Including instructions to verify the code running inside TEEs.
- LLM inference is executed inside [Amazon Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/).
- The enclave can't be accessed from the outside to ensure agent’s security.

**On-chain verifiability with Solana.**

<!-- **Civitas Explorer.**

- Enables discovery of full history for all verified agents’ inferences. [See here](https://explorer.galadriel.com/). -->

**Easy to use developer experience.**

- No need to know the underlying cryptographic primitives of TEE’s.
